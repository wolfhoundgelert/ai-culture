# AI - The Way of Thinking
Program to implement a strong AI culture throughout the company.

I am an IT Project Manager and AI Enthusiast with a versatile technical background. [Here](https://github.com/wolfhoundgelert/ai-culture/blob/main/AI%20-%20The%20Way%20of%20Thinking%2C%20v1.0.pdf) is my vision on what should be implemented in the company and which practical steps could be taken to achieve it in order to cultivate a strong AI culture in the organization that strives to achieve great success in the rapidly changing and aggressive environment where the ongoing AI revolution takes place nowadays.

The main idea is that it is not enough for a company to only have a dedicated AI department. It is also necessary to raise and develop knowledge and practical skills in the use of AI in all employees in order to improve their efficiency, productivity, and creativity. Only a good understanding of AI capabilities by everyone in the company can move the organization forward as effectively as possible, because only people on the ground know their domains and their needs, and can define new areas for growth with the help of modern AI technologies.
